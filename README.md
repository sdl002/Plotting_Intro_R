# Plotting_Intro_R
This is an intro to plotting with R, and will introduce basic ggplot techniques as well as how to intregrate with Plotly.

### There are a lot of Intros on ggplot2 available, I put together a brief overview that takes no more than 1 hour to work through, but I highly reccomend also considering the following tutorials for a more in depth training:
1. http://r-statistics.co/Complete-Ggplot2-Tutorial-Part1-With-R-Code.html  
2. https://rpubs.com/arvindpdmn/ggplot2-basics  
3. https://bookdown.org/skaltman/visualization-book/the-basics-of-ggplot2.html  

Some examples used below are from the above links

## The Basics: What is ggplot2?

ggplot2 is an R package that allows for customizable data visualization. It is part of the tidyverse package suite and is a very well maintained and continuously updated package. https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/

To use ggplot2, you will need to have access to `R`. You can either use a local installation or a sever installation. 

To install ggplot2 you can do the following:

### The easiest way to get ggplot2 is to install the whole tidyverse:
```
install.packages("tidyverse")
```

### Alternatively, install just ggplot2:
```
install.packages("ggplot2")
```
